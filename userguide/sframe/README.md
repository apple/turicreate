# Working with Data

Prior to model creation, one has to often parse, clean, and manipulate
data to make it ready. Many of these tasks have been written into Turi
Create. This section describes how to import data from different sources
into various Turi data structures, reshape unstructured data, make
transformations of existing data quickly, and compute summary
statistics.

With Turi Create, you can work with:
- [Tabular data](sframe-intro.md)
- [Graphs](../sgraph/sgraph.md)
- [Text data](../text/analysis.md)
- [Visualization](../vis/README.md)

As always, reference the [API
docs](https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/turicreate.data_structures.html)
for more information.
