  Verifies that a bodyless response don't parse this content-related
  header.

- [Michael Kaufmann brought this change]

  http: don't parse body-related headers bodyless responses
  
  Responses with status codes 1xx, 204 or 304 don't have a response body. For
  these, don't parse these headers:
  
  - Content-Encoding
  - Content-Length
  - Content-Range
  - Last-Modified
  - Transfer-Encoding
  
  This change ensures that HTTP/2 upgrades work even if a
  "Content-Length: 0" or a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header is present.

  http2: Stop drain from being permanently set on
  
  Various functions called within Curl_http2_done() can have the
  side-effect of setting the Easy connection into drain mode (by calling
  drain_this()).  However, the last time we unset this for a transfer (by
  calling drained_transfer()) is at the beginning of Curl_http2_done().
  If the Curl_easy is reused for another transfer, it is then stuck in
  drain mode permanently, which in practice makes it unable to write any
  data in the new transfer.
  
  This fix moves the last call to drained_transfer() to later in
  Curl_http2_done(), after the functions that could potentially call for a
  drain.

  Closes #3967

  They need to be removed from the socket hash linked list with more care.
  
  When sh_delentry() is called to remove a sockethash entry, remove all
  individual transfers from the list first. To enable this, each Curl_easy struct
  now stores a pointer to the sockethash entry to know how to remove itself.

- version: make ssl_version buffer match for multi_ssl
  
  When running a multi TLS backend build the version string needs more
  buffer space. Make the internal ssl_buffer stack buffer match the one
  in Curl_multissl_version() to allow for the longer string. For single
  TLS backend builds there is no use in extended to buffer. This is a
  fallout from #3863 which fixes up the multi_ssl string generation to
  avoid a buffer overflow when the buffer is too small.

- http_ntlm_wb: Handle auth for only a single request
  
  Currently when the server responds with 401 on NTLM authenticated

  legitimate and may happen when for example IIS is set configured to
  'authPersistSingleRequest' or when the request goes thru a proxy (with

  I missed this one in commit 6b3dde7fe62ea5a557fd1fd323fac2bcd0c2e9be.

- build: fix "clarify calculation precedence" warnings
  
  Codacy/CppCheck warns about this. Consistently use parentheses as we
  already do in some places to silence the warning.

Jay Satiro (10 May 2019)
- Revert "multi: support verbose conncache closure handle"
  
  This reverts commit b0972bc.
  
  - No longer show verbose output for the conncache closure handle.
  
  The offending commit was added so that the conncache closure handle
  would inherit verbose mode from the user's easy handle. (Note there is
  no way for the user to set options for the closure handle which is why
  that was necessary.) Other debug settings such as the debug function
  were not also inherited since we determined that could lead to crashes
  if the user's per-handle private data was used on an unexpected handle.
  
  The reporter here says he has a debug function to capture the verbose
  output, and does not expect or want any output to stderr; however
  because the conncache closure handle does not inherit the debug function
  the verbose output for that handle does go to stderr.
  
  There are other plausible scenarios as well such as the user redirects
  stderr on their handle, which is also not inherited since it could lead
  to crashes when used on an unexpected handle.
  
  Short of allowing the user to set options for the conncache closure
  handle I don't think there's much we can safely do except no longer
  inherit the verbose setting.

- http: Ignore HTTP/2 prior knowledge setting for HTTP proxies
  
  - Do not switch to HTTP/2 for an HTTP proxy that is not tunnelling to
    the destination host.
  
  We already do something similar for HTTPS proxies by not sending h2. [1]
  
  Prior to this change setting CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE would
  incorrectly use HTTP/2 to talk to the proxy, which is not something we
  support (yet?). Also it's debatable whether or not that setting should
  apply to HTTP/2 proxies.

  OpenSSL: Report -fips in version if OpenSSL is built with FIPS
  
  Older versions of OpenSSL report FIPS availabilty via an OPENSSL_FIPS
  define. It uses this define to determine whether to publish -fips at
  the end of the version displayed. Applications that utilize the version
  reported by OpenSSL will see a mismatch if they compare it to what curl
  reports, as curl is not modifying the version in the same way. This
  change simply adds a check to see if OPENSSL_FIPS is defined, and will
  alter the reported version to match what OpenSSL itself provides. This
  only appears to be applicable in versions of OpenSSL <1.1.1
  
  Closes #3771

  nss: allow fifos and character devices for certificates.
  
  Currently you can do things like --cert <(cat ./cert.crt) with (at least) the
  openssl backend, but that doesn't work for nss because is_file rejects fifos.
  
  I don't actually know if this is sufficient, nss might do things internally

- process_pending_handles: mark queued transfers as previously pending
  
  With transfers being queued up, we only move one at a a time back to the
  CONNECT state but now we mark moved transfers so that when a moved
  transfer is confirmed "successful" (it connected) it will trigger the
  move of another pending transfer. Previously, it would otherwise wait
  until the transfer was done before doing this. This makes queued up
  pending transfers get processed (much) faster.

- xattr: skip unittest on unsupported platforms
  
  The stripcredentials unittest fails to compile on platforms without
  xattr support, for example the Solaris member in the buildfarm which
  fails with the following:
  
    CC unit1621-unit1621.o
    CC ../libtest/unit1621-first.o
    CCLD unit1621
    Undefined first referenced

    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    gmake[2]: *** [Makefile:996: unit1621] Error 1
  
  Fix by excluding the test on such platforms by using the reverse

- cmake: clear CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES after each use
  
  This fixes GSSAPI builds with the libraries in a non-standard location.
  The testing for recv() were failing because it failed to link
  the Kerberos libraries, which are not needed for this or subsequent
  tests.
  
  fixes #3743
  closes #3744

- cmake: avoid linking executable for some tests with cmake 3.6+
  
  With CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE set to STATIC_LIBRARY, the try_compile()
  (which is used by check_c_source_compiles()) will build static library
  instead of executable. This avoids linking additional libraries in and thus
  speeds up those checks a little.
  
  This commit also avoids #3743 (GSSAPI build errors) on itself with cmake
  3.6 or above. That issue was fixed separately for all versions.

- doh: inherit some SSL options from user's easy handle
  
  - Inherit SSL options for the doh handle but not SSL client certs,

    SSL pinned public key, SSL ciphers, SSL id cache setting,
    SSL kerberos or SSL gss-api settings.
  
  - Fix inheritance of verbose setting.
  
  - Inherit NOSIGNAL.
  
  There is no way for the user to set options for the doh (DNS-over-HTTPS)
  handles and instead we inherit some options from the user's easy handle.
  
  My thinking for the SSL options not inherited is they are most likely
  not intended by the user for the DOH transfer. I did inherit insecure
  because I think that should still be in control of the user.
  
  Prior to this change doh did not work for me because CAINFO was not
  inherited. Also verbose was set always which AFAICT was a bug (#3660).

- multi: support verbose conncache closure handle
  
  - Change closure handle to receive verbose setting from the easy handle
    most recently added via curl_multi_add_handle.
  
  The closure handle is a special easy handle used for closing cached
  connections. It receives limited settings from the easy handle most
  recently added to the multi handle. Prior to this change that did not
  include verbose which was a problem because on connection shutdown
  verbose mode was not acknowledged.

- [Arnaud Rebillout brought this change]

  examples: various fixes in ephiperfifo.c

  1000). This resulted in the callback being invoked WAY TOO OFTEN.

  commit:

  If the cookieinfo pointer is NULL there really is nothing to save.
  
  Without this fix, we got a problem when a handle was using shared object
  with cookies and is told to "FLUSH" it to file (which worked) and then
  the share object was removed and when the easy handle was closed just
  afterwards it has no cookieinfo and no cookies so it decided to save an

- easy: fix win32 init to work without CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32
  
  - Change the behavior of win32_init so that the required initialization
    procedures are not affected by CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 flag.
  
  libcurl via curl_global_init supports initializing for win32 with an
  optional flag CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32, which if omitted was meant to stop
  Winsock initialization. It did so internally by skipping win32_init()
  when that flag was set. Since then win32_init() has been expanded to
  include required initialization routines that are separate from
  Winsock and therefore must be called in all cases. This commit fixes
  it so that CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 only controls the optional win32
  initialization (which is Winsock initialization, according to our doc).
  
  The only users affected by this change are those that don't pass
  CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32 to curl_global_init. For them this commit removes the
  risk of a potential crash.

  connection_check: restore original conn->data after the check
  
  - Save the original conn->data before it's changed to the specified
    data transfer for the connection check and then restore it afterwards.
  
  This is a follow-up to 38d8e1b 2019-02-11.
  
  History:
  
  It was discovered a month ago that before checking whether to extract a
  dead connection that that connection should be associated with a "live"
  transfer for the check (ie original conn->data ignored and set to the
  passed in data). A fix was landed in 54b201b which did that and also
  cleared conn->data after the check. The original conn->data was not
  restored, so presumably it was thought that a valid conn->data was no
  longer needed.
  
  Several days later it was discovered that a valid conn->data was needed
  after the check and follow-up fix was landed in bbae24c which partially
  reverted the original fix and attempted to limit the scope of when
  conn->data was changed to only when pruning dead connections. In that
  case conn->data was not cleared and the original conn->data not
  restored.
  
  A month later it was discovered that the original fix was somewhat
  correct; a "live" transfer is needed for the check in all cases
  because original conn->data could be null which could cause a bad deref
  at arbitrary points in the check. A fix was landed in 38d8e1b which
  expanded the scope to all cases. conn->data was not cleared and the
  original conn->data not restored.
  
  A day later it was discovered that not restoring the original conn->data
  may lead to busy loops in applications that use the event interface, and
  given this observation it's a pretty safe assumption that there is some
  code path that still needs the original conn->data. This commit is the
  follow-up fix for that, it restores the original conn->data after the
  connection check.

- unit1307: require FTP support
  
  This test doesn't link without FTP support after
  fc7ab4835b5fd09d0a6f57000633bb6bb6edfda1, which made Curl_fnmatch
  unavailable without FTP support.
  
  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/3565

Daniel Stenberg (13 Feb 2019)
- TODO: TFO support on Windows
  
  Nobody works on this now.
  
  Closes #3378

- multi: Dereference of null pointer
  
  Mostly a false positive, but this makes the code easier to read anyway.
  
  Detected by scan-build.
  
  Closes #3563

- urlglob: Argument with 'nonnull' attribute passed null
  
  Detected by scan-build.

- schannel: restore some debug output but only for debug builds
  
  Follow-up to 84c10dc from earlier today which wrapped a lot of the noisy
  debug output in DEBUGF but omitted a few lines.

- examples/crawler: Fix the Accept-Encoding setting
  
  - Pass an empty string to CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING to use the default
    supported encodings.
  
  Prior to this change the specific encodings of gzip and deflate were set
  but there's no guarantee they'd be supported by the user's libcurl.

- mime: put the boundary buffer into the curl_mime struct
  
  ... instead of allocating it separately and point to it. It is
  fixed-size and always used for each part.
  
  Closes #3561

- schannel: be quiet
  
  Convert numerous infof() calls into debug-build only messages since they
  are annoyingly verbose for regular applications. Removed a few.

  tests: add stderr comparison to the test suite
  
  The code is more or less copied from the stdout comparison code, maybe
  some better reuse is possible.
  
  test 1457 is adjusted to make the output actually match (by using --silent)
  test 506 used <stderr> without actually needing it, so that <stderr> block is removed
  
  Closes #3536

- zsh.pl: escape ':' character
  
  ':' is interpreted as separator by zsh, so if used as part of the argument
  or option's description it needs to be escaped.
  
  The problem can be reproduced as follows:
  
   % curl --reso<TAB>
   % curl -E <TAB>
  
  Bug: https://bugs.debian.org/921452

- zsh.pl: update regex to better match curl -h output
  
  The current regex fails to match '<...>' arguments properly (e.g. those
  with spaces in them), which causes an completion script with wrong
  descriptions for some options.
  
  Here's a diff of the generated completion script, comparing the previous
  version to the one with this fix:

  runtests.pl: Fix perl call to include srcdir
  
  - Use explicit include opt for perl calls.
  
  Prior to this change some scripts couldn't find their dependencies.

  works:
  
  https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-7_63_0/tests/runtests.pl#L183

   Problem 1
  
  After LOTS of scratching my head, I eventually realized that even when doing
  10 uploads in parallel, sometimes the socket callback to the application that
  tells it what to wait for on the socket, looked like it would reflect the
  status of just the single transfer that just changed state.
  
  Digging into the code revealed that this was indeed the truth. When multiple
  transfers are using the same connection, the application did not correctly get
  the *combined* flags for all transfers which then could make it switch to READ
  (only) when in fact most transfers wanted to get told when the socket was
  WRITEABLE.
  
   Problem 1b
  
  A separate but related regression had also been introduced by me when I
  cleared connection/transfer association better a while ago, as now the logic
  couldn't find the connection and see if that was marked as used by more
  transfers and then it would also prematurely remove the socket from the socket
  hash table even in times other transfers were still using it!
  
   Fix 1
  
  Make sure that each socket stored in the socket hash has a "combined" action
  field of what to ask the application to wait for, that is potentially the ORed
  action of multiple parallel transfers. And remove that socket hash entry only
  if there are no transfers left using it.
  
   Problem 2
  
  The socket hash entry stored an association to a single transfer using that
  socket - and when curl_multi_socket_action() was called to tell libcurl about
  activities on that specific socket only that transfer was "handled".
  
  This was WRONG, as a single socket/connection can be used by numerous parallel
  transfers and not necessarily a single one.
  
   Fix 2
  
  We now store a list of handles in the socket hashtable entry and when libcurl
  is told there's traffic for a particular socket, it now iterates over all
  known transfers using that single socket.

- disconnect: separate connections and easy handles better
  
  Do not assume/store assocation between a given easy handle and the

  little too error-prone. Still used very widely though.

- OS400: handle memory error in list conversion
  
  Curl_slist_append_nodup() returns NULL when it fails to create a new

  point during the conversion, with allocation succeeding again on the
  subsequent call(s) we will return a truncated list around the malloc
  failure point. Fix by assigning to a temporary list pointer, which can
  be checked (which is the common pattern for slist appending), and free

- travis: enable COPYRIGHTYEAR extended warning
  
  The extended warning for checking incorrect COPYRIGHTYEAR is quite
  expensive to run, so rather than expecting every developer to do it
  we ensure it's turned on locally for Travis.

- checksrc: add COPYRIGHTYEAR check
  
  Forgetting to bump the year in the copyright clause when hacking has
  been quite common among curl developers, but a traditional checksrc
  check isn't a good fit as it would penalize anyone hacking on January
  1st (among other things). This adds a more selective COPYRIGHTYEAR
  check which intends to only cover the currently hacked on changeset.
  
  The check for updated copyright year is currently not enforced on all
  files but only on files edited and/or committed locally. This is due to
  the amount of files which aren't updated with their correct copyright
  year at the time of their respective commit.
  
  To further avoid running this expensive check for every developer, it
  adds a new local override mode for checksrc where a .checksrc file can
  be used to turn on extended warnings locally.

- openssl: support session resume with TLS 1.3
  
  Session resumption information is not available immediately after a TLS 1.3
  handshake. The client must wait until the server has sent a session ticket.
  
  Use OpenSSL's "new session" callback to get the session information and put it
  into curl's session cache. For TLS 1.3 sessions, this callback will be invoked
  after the server has sent a session ticket.
  
  The "new session" callback is invoked only if OpenSSL's session cache is
  enabled, so enable it and use the "external storage" mode which lets curl manage
  the contents of the session cache.
  
  A pointer to the connection data and the sockindex are now saved as "SSL extra
  data" to make them available to the callback.
  
  This approach also works for old SSL/TLS versions and old OpenSSL versions.

  ares: remove fd from multi fd set when ares is about to close the fd
  
  When using c-ares for asyn dns, the dns socket fd was silently closed
  by c-ares without curl being aware. curl would then 'realize' the fd
  has been removed at next call of Curl_resolver_getsock, and only then
  notify the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION to remove fd from its poll set with
  CURL_POLL_REMOVE. At this point the fd is already closed.
  
  By using ares socket state callback (ARES_OPT_SOCK_STATE_CB), this
  patch allows curl to be notified that the fd is not longer needed
  for neither for write nor read. At this point by calling
  Curl_multi_closed we are able to notify multi with CURL_POLL_REMOVE
  before the fd is actually closed by ares.

- tool_doswin: Fix uninitialized field warning
  
  The partial struct initialization in 397664a065abffb7c3445ca9 caused
  a warning on uninitialized MODULEENTRY32 struct members:

    'th32ModuleID' of 'MODULEENTRY32 {aka struct tagMODULEENTRY32}'
    [-Wmissing-field-initializers]
  
  This is sort of a bogus warning as the remaining members will be set
  to zero by the compiler, as all omitted members are. Nevertheless,
  remove the warning by omitting all members and setting the dwSize
  members explicitly.

  The SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback callback is not just called for the
  Handshake or Alert protocols, but also for the raw record header
  (SSL3_RT_HEADER) and the decrypted inner record type

- tool_cb_wrt: Silence function cast compiler warning
  
  Commit 5bfaa86ceb3c2a9ac474a928e748c4a86a703b33 introduced a new
  compiler warning on Windows cross compilation with GCC. See below
  for an example of the warning from the autobuild logs (whitespace
  edited to fit):
  
  /src/tool_cb_wrt.c:175:9: warning: cast from function call of type
      'intptr_t {aka long long int}' to non-matching type 'void *'
      [-Wbad-function-cast]
  (HANDLE) _get_osfhandle(fileno(outs->stream)),
  ^
  
  Store the return value from _get_osfhandle() in an intermediate
  variable and cast the variable in WriteConsoleW() rather than the
  function call directly to avoid a compiler warning.
  
  In passing, also add inspection of the MultiByteToWideChar() return
  value and return failure in case an error is reported.

  handshake.
  
  Enable renegotiation by default with BoringSSL to get same behavior as

  x509asn1: Fix SAN IP address verification
  
  For IP addresses in the subject alternative name field, the length
  of the IP address (and hence the number of bytes to perform a
  memcmp on) is incorrectly calculated to be zero. The code previously
  subtracted q from name.end. where in a successful case q = name.end
  and therefore addrlen equalled 0. The change modifies the code to
  subtract name.beg from name.end to calculate the length correctly.
  
  The issue only affects libcurl with GSKit SSL, not other SSL backends.
  The issue is not a security issue as IP verification would always fail.

- vtls: fix ssl version "or later" behavior change for many backends
  
  - Treat CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_NONE the same as
    CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT. Prior to this change NONE would mean use
    the minimum version also as the maximum.
  
  This is a follow-up to 6015cef which changed the behavior of setting
  the SSL version so that the requested version would only be the minimum
  and not the maximum. It appears it was (mostly) implemented in OpenSSL
  but not other backends. In other words CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_0 used to
  mean use just TLS v1.0 and now it means use TLS v1.0 *or later*.
  
  - Fix CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT for OpenSSL.
  
  Prior to this change CURL_SSLVERSION_MAX_DEFAULT with OpenSSL was
  erroneously treated as always TLS 1.3, and would cause an error if
  OpenSSL was built without TLS 1.3 support.

  will guess "http://".
  
  Separately, it relaxes the check of the host name so that IDN host names
  can be passed in as well.
  
  Both these changes are necessary for libcurl itself to use this API.

  cookies: support creation-time attribute for cookies
  
  According to RFC6265 section 5.4, cookies with equal path lengths
  SHOULD be sorted by creation-time (earlier first). This adds a
  creation-time record to the cookie struct in order to make cookie
  sorting more deterministic. The creation-time is defined as the
  order of the cookies in the jar, the first cookie read fro the

  updated to match.

- Don't use Windows path %PWD for SSH tests
  
  All these tests failed on Windows because something like
  sftp://%HOSTIP:%SSHPORT%PWD/
  expanded to
  sftp://127.0.0.1:1234c:/msys64/home/bla/curl
  and then curl complained about the port number ending with a letter.
  
  Use the original POSIX path instead of the Windows path created in
  checksystem to fix this.

  schannel: client certificate store opening fix
  
  1) Using CERT_STORE_OPEN_EXISTING_FLAG ( or CERT_STORE_READONLY_FLAG )
  while opening certificate store would be sufficient in this scenario and
  less-demanding in sense of required user credentials ( for example,
  IIS_IUSRS will get "Access Denied" 0x05 error for existing CertOpenStore
  call without any of flags mentioned above ),
  
  2) as 'cert_store_name' is a DWORD, attempt to format its value like a
  string ( in "Failed to open cert store" error message ) will throw null
  pointer exception
  
  3) adding GetLastError(), in my opinion, will make error message more
  useful.

  gopher: Do not translate `?' to `%09'
  
  Since GOPHER support was added in curl `?' character was automatically
  translated to `%09' (`\t').
  
  However, this behaviour does not seems documented in RFC 4266 and for
  search selectors it is documented to directly use `%09' in the URL.
  Apart that several gopher servers in the current gopherspace have CGI
  support where `?' is used as part of the selector and translating it to
  `%09' often leads to surprising results.
  
  Closes #2910

- libcurl-thread.3: expand somewhat on the NO_SIGNAL motivation
  
  Multi-threaded applictions basically MUST set CURLOPT_NO_SIGNAL to 1L to
  avoid the risk of getting a SIGPIPE.
  
  Either way, a multi-threaded application that uses libcurl/openssl needs
  to have a signhandler for or ignore SIGPIPE on its own.
  
  Based on discussions in #2800
  Closes #2904

- test1148: disable if decimal separator is not point
  
  Modifying the locale with environment variables doesn't work for native
  Windows applications. Just disable the test in this case if the decimal
  separator is something different than a point. Use a precheck with a
  small C program to achieve that.

- Enable more GCC warnings
  
  This enables the following additional warnings:
  -Wold-style-definition
  -Warray-bounds=2 instead of the default 1
  -Wformat=2, but only for GCC 4.8+ as Wno-format-nonliteral is not
   respected for older versions
  -Wunused-const-variable, which enables level 2 instead of the default 1
  -Warray-bounds also in debug mode through -ftree-vrp
  -Wnull-dereference also in debug mode through
   -fdelete-null-pointer-checks
  
  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2747

- curl-compilers: enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough=4 for GCC
  
  This enables level 4 instead of the default level 3, which of the
  currently used comments only allows /* FALLTHROUGH */ to silence the
  warning.
  
  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2747

- curl-compilers: enable -Wbad-function-cast on GCC
  
  This warning used to be enabled only for clang as it's a bit stricter
  on GCC. Silence the remaining occurrences and enable it on GCC too.
  
  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2747

- configure: conditionally enable pedantic-errors
  
  Enable pedantic-errors for GCC >= 5 with --enable-werror. Before GCC 5,
  pedantic-errors was synonymous to -Werror=pedantic [0], which is still
  the case for clang [1]. With GCC 5, it became complementary [2].
  
  Also fix a resulting error in acinclude.m4 as main's return type was
  missing, which is illegal in C99.

  vtls: reinstantiate engine on duplicated handles
  
  Handles created with curl_easy_duphandle do not use the SSL engine set

  inside curl_easy_duphandle.
