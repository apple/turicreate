nn_symbol(3)
============

NAME
----
nn_symbol - query the names and values of nanomsg symbols


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*const char *nn_symbol (int 'i', int '*value');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the symbol name and value at index 'i'.  Indices start at 0.  An index
has no significance to its associated symbol; the mappings may change between
library versions.

Typically a client will iterate through the symbols until nn_symbol returns
NULL in order to collect all the symbols.

All symbols exposed by 'nn_symbol' are available directly in the C API,
generally as preprocessor macros.  Thus, this function is useful mostly for
language bindings that can't parse the header file and rely on retrieving the
symbols in the runtime.

Note that the NN_MSG symbol is not exported by the _nn_symbol_ function. First,
it is a pointer rather than an integer; second, the symbol is not supposed to
be exported from language bindings to the user. Instead, language bindings
should provide the zero-copy functionality in a language-specific way, if at
all (zero-copy functionality may not make sense for some languages/bindings).


RETURN VALUE
------------
If 'i' is valid, returns the name of the symbol at that index.  If the pointer
'value' is not NULL, the symbol's value is stored there.

If 'i' is out-of-range, nn_symbol returns NULL and sets 'errno' to EINVAL.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The passed index 'i' was out-of-range; it was less than zero or greater-than-or-
equal-to the number of symbols.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
int value, i;
for (i = 0; ; ++i) {
    const char* name = nn_symbol (i, &value);
    if (name == NULL) break;
    printf ("'%s' = %d\n", name, value);
}
