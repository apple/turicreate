NAME
----
nn_tcp - TCP transport mechanism


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*#include <nanomsg/tcp.h>*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
TCP transport allows for passing messages over the network using simple reliable
one-to-one connections. TCP is the most widely used transport protocol, it is
virtually ubiquitous and thus the transport of choice for communication over
the network.

When binding a TCP socket address of the form tcp://interface:port should be
used. Port is the TCP port number to use. Interface is one of the following
(optionally placed within square brackets):

*  Asterisk character (*) meaning all local network interfaces.
*  IPv4 address of a local network interface in numeric form (192.168.0.111).
*  IPv6 address of a local network interface in numeric form (::1).

When connecting a TCP socket address of the form tcp://interface;address:port
should be used. Port is the TCP port number to use. Interface is optional and
specifies which local network interface to use. If not specified, OS will select
an appropriate interface itself. If specified it can be one of the following
(optionally placed within square brackets):

*  IPv4 address of a local network interface in numeric form (192.168.0.111).
*  IPv6 address of a local network interface in numeric form (::1).

Finally, address specifies the remote address to connect to. It can be one of
the following (optionally placed within square brackets):

*  IPv4 address of a remote network interface in numeric form (192.168.0.111).
*  IPv6 address of a remote network interface in numeric form (::1).
*  The DNS name of the remote box.


Socket Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NN_TCP_NODELAY::
    This option, when set to 1, disables Nagle's algorithm. It also disables
    delaying of TCP acknowledgments. Using this option improves latency at
    the expense of throughput. Type of this option is int. Default value is 0.
