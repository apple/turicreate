^CMake Deprecation Warning at CMP0063-OLD.cmake:[0-9]+ \(cmake_policy\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0063 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
