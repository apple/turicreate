# as with read-only sources fresh from tarball, regress.gen.[ch] will
# be correct in $srcdir but unwritable.  This previously triggered
# Makefile.am to create stub regress.gen.c and regress.gen.h in the
# distcheck _build directory, which were then detected as leftover
# files in the build tree after distclean, breaking distcheck.
# Note that regress.gen.[ch] are not in fresh git clones, making
# working Python a requirement for make distcheck of a git tree.
