.Sh NAME
.Nm mtree
.Nd format of mtree dir hierarchy files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
format is a textual format that describes a collection of filesystem objects.
Such files are typically used to create or verify directory hierarchies.
.Ss General Format
An
.Nm
file consists of a series of lines, each providing information
about a single filesystem object.
Leading whitespace is always ignored.
.Pp
When encoding file or pathnames, any backslash character or
character outside of the 95 printable ASCII characters must be
encoded as a a backslash followed by three
octal digits.
When reading mtree files, any appearance of a backslash
followed by three octal digits should be converted into the
corresponding character.
.Pp
Each line is interpreted independently as one of the following types:
.Bl -tag -width Cm
.It Blank
Blank lines are ignored.
.It Comment
Lines beginning with
.Cm #
are ignored.
.It Special
Lines beginning with
.Cm /
are special commands that influence
the interpretation of later lines.
.It Relative
If the first whitespace-delimited word has no
.Cm /
characters,
it is the name of a file in the current directory.
Any relative entry that describes a directory changes the
current directory.
.It dot-dot
As a special case, a relative entry with the filename
.Pa ..
changes the current directory to the parent directory.
Options on dot-dot entries are always ignored.
.It Full
If the first whitespace-delimited word has a
.Cm /
character after
the first character, it is the pathname of a file relative to the
starting directory.
There can be multiple full entries describing the same file.
.El
.Pp
Some tools that process
.Nm
files may require that multiple lines describing the same file
occur consecutively.
It is not permitted for the same file to be mentioned using
both a relative and a full file specification.
.Ss Special commands
Two special commands are currently defined:
.Bl -tag -width Cm
.It Cm /set
This command defines default values for one or more keywords.
It is followed on the same line by one or more whitespace-separated
keyword definitions.
These definitions apply to all following files that do not specify
a value for that keyword.
.It Cm /unset
This command removes any default value set by a previous
.Cm /set
command.
It is followed on the same line by one or more keywords
separated by whitespace.
.El
.Ss Keywords
After the filename, a full or relative entry consists of zero
or more whitespace-separated keyword definitions.
Each such definition consists of a key from the following
list immediately followed by an '=' sign
and a value.
Software programs reading mtree files should warn about
unrecognized keywords.
.Pp
Currently supported keywords are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Cm
.It Cm cksum
The checksum of the file using the default algorithm specified by
the
.Xr cksum 1
utility.
.It Cm device
The device number for
.Sy block
or
.Sy char
file types.
The value must be one of the following forms:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Ar format , Ns Ar major , Ns Ar minor Ns Bo , Ns Ar subunit Bc
A device with
.Ar major , minor
and optional
.Ar subunit
fields.
Their meaning is specified by the operating's system
.Ar format .
See below for valid formats.
.It Ar number
Opaque number (as stored on the file system).
.El
.Pp
The following values for
.Ar format
are recognized:
.Sy native ,
.Sy 386bsd ,
.Sy 4bsd ,
.Sy bsdos ,
.Sy freebsd ,
.Sy hpux ,
.Sy isc ,
.Sy linux ,
.Sy netbsd ,
.Sy osf1 ,
.Sy sco ,
.Sy solaris ,
.Sy sunos ,
.Sy svr3 ,
.Sy svr4 ,  
and 
.Sy ultrix .
.Pp

.Xr mknod 8
for more details.
.It Cm contents
The full pathname of a file that holds the contents of this file.
.It Cm flags
The file flags as a symbolic name.
See
.Xr chflags 1
for information on these names.
If no flags are to be set the string
.Dq none
may be used to override the current default.
.It Cm gid
The file group as a numeric value.
.It Cm gname
The file group as a symbolic name.
.It Cm ignore
Ignore any file hierarchy below this file.
.It Cm inode
The inode number.

.It Cm mode
The current file's permissions as a numeric (octal) or symbolic
value.
.It Cm nlink
The number of hard links the file is expected to have.
.It Cm nochange
Make sure this file or directory exists but otherwise ignore all attributes.
.It Cm optional
The file is optional; do not complain about the file if it is not in
the file hierarchy.
.It Cm resdevice
The
.Dq resident
device number of the file, e.g. the ID of the device that
contains the file.
Its format is the same as the one for

.Sh BUGS
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
The
.Tn MD5
digest capability was added in
.Fx 2.1 ,
in response to the widespread use of programs which can spoof
.Xr cksum 1 .
The
.Tn SHA-1
and
.Tn RIPEMD160
digests were added in
.Fx 4.0 ,
as new attacks have demonstrated weaknesses in
.Tn MD5 .
The
.Tn SHA-256
digest was added in
.Fx 6.0 .
Support for file flags was added in
.Fx 4.0 ,
and mostly comes from
.Nx .
The
.Dq full
entry format was added by
.Nx .
