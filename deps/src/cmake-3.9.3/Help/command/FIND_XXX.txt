A short-hand signature is:

.. parsed-literal::

   |FIND_XXX| (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

The general signature is:

.. parsed-literal::

   |FIND_XXX| (
             <VAR>
             name | |NAMES|
             [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
             [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
             [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
             [DOC "cache documentation string"]
             [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
             [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
             [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
             [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
             [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
             [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
              ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
            )

This command is used to find a |SEARCH_XXX_DESC|.
A cache entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result
of this command.
If the |SEARCH_XXX| is found the result is stored in the variable
and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.
If nothing is found, the result will be
``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, and the search will be attempted again the
next time |FIND_XXX| is invoked with the same variable.

Options include:

``NAMES``
  Specify one or more possible names for the |SEARCH_XXX|.

  When using this to specify names with and without a version
  suffix, we recommend specifying the unversioned name first
  so that locally-built packages can be found before those
  provided by distributions.

``HINTS``, ``PATHS``
  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.
  The ``ENV var`` sub-option reads paths from a system environment
  variable.

``PATH_SUFFIXES``
  Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory
  location otherwise considered.

``DOC``
  Specify the documentation string for the ``<VAR>`` cache entry.

If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified, then no additional paths are
added to the search.
If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is not specified, the search process is as follows:

.. |CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR| replace::
   |prefix_XXX_SUBDIR| for each ``<prefix>`` in :variable:`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`

.. |SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR| replace::
   |prefix_XXX_SUBDIR| for each ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` in ``PATH``, and
   |entry_XXX_SUBDIR| for other entries in ``PATH``

.. |CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH_XXX_SUBDIR| replace::
   |prefix_XXX_SUBDIR| for each ``<prefix>`` in
   :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`

1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.
   These are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`;-lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed.

   * |CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH_XXX|
   * |CMAKE_XXX_PATH|
   * |CMAKE_XXX_MAC_PATH|

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed.

   * |CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH_XXX|
   * |CMAKE_XXX_PATH|
   * |CMAKE_XXX_MAC_PATH|

3. Search the paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.
   These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
   hint provided by the location of another item already found.
   Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

4. Search the standard system environment variables.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is an argument.

   * |SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH_XXX|

5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
   for the current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   is passed.

   * |CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH_XXX|
   * |CMAKE_SYSTEM_XXX_PATH|
   * |CMAKE_SYSTEM_XXX_MAC_PATH|

6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option
   or in the short-hand version of the command.
   These are typically hard-coded guesses.

.. |FIND_ARGS_XXX| replace:: <VAR> NAMES name

On OS X the :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK` and
:variable:`CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE` variables determine the order of
preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.
