Classes derived from

--
1. `rule __init__ ( name : project )`
+
`name`::
  The name of the target in the Jamfile.
`project`::
  The link:#bbv2.reference.class.project-target[project] to which this
  target belongs.

2. `rule name ( )`
+
Returns the name of this target.

3. `rule project ( )`
+
Returns the link:#bbv2.reference.class.project-target[project] for this
target.

4. `rule location ( )`
+
Returns the location where the target was declared.

5. `rule full-name ( )`
+
Returns a user-readable name for this target.

6. [[bbv2.reference.class.abstract-target.generate]] `rule generate ( property-set )`
+
Generates virtual targets for this abstract target using the specified
properties, unless a different value of some feature is required by the
target. This is an abstract method which must be overridden by derived
classes.
+
On success, returns:
+
* a property-set with the usage requirements to be applied to dependents
* a list of produced virtual targets, which may be empty.
+
If `property-set` is empty, performs the default build of this target,
in a way specific to the derived class.
