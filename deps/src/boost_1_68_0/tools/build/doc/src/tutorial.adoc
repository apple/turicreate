This section will guide you though the most basic features of
Boost.Build. We will start with the “Hello, world” example, learn how to
use libraries, and finish with testing and installing features.

[[bbv2.tutorial.hello]]
== Hello, world

The simplest project that Boost.Build can construct is stored in
`example/hello/` directory. The project is described by a file called
`Jamroot` that contains:

[source]
----
exe hello : hello.cpp ;
----

Even with this simple setup, you can do some interesting things. First
of all, just invoking `b2` will build the `hello` executable by compiling
and linking `hello.cpp`. By default, the debug variant is built. Now, to
build the release variant of `hello`, invoke

[source,shell]
----
b2 release
----

Note that the debug and release variants are created in different
directories, so you can switch between variants or even build multiple
variants at once, without any unnecessary recompilation. Let us extend
the example by adding another line to our project's `Jamroot`:

[source]
----
exe hello2 : hello.cpp ;
----

Now let us build both the debug and release variants of our project
again:

[source,shell]
----
b2 debug release
----

Note that two variants of `hello2` are linked. Since we have already
built both variants of `hello`, hello.cpp will not be recompiled;
instead the existing object files will just be linked into the
corresponding variants of `hello2`. Now let us remove all the built
products:

[source,shell]
----
b2 --clean debug release
----

It is also possible to build or clean specific targets. The following
two commands, respectively, build or clean only the debug version of
`hello2`.

[source,shell]
----
b2 hello2
b2 --clean hello2
----

[[bbv2.tutorial.properties]]
== Properties

To represent aspects of target configuration such as debug and release
variants, or single- and multi-threaded builds portably, Boost.Build
uses _features_ with associated _values_. For example, the `debug-symbols`
feature can have a value of `on` or `off`. A _property_ is just a
(feature, value) pair. When a user initiates a build, Boost.Build
automatically translates the requested properties into appropriate
command-line flags for invoking toolset components like compilers and
linkers.

There are many built-in features that can be combined to produce
arbitrary build configurations. The following command builds the
project's `release` variant with inlining disabled and debug symbols
enabled:

[source,shell]
----
b2 release inlining=off debug-symbols=on
----

Properties on the command-line are specified with the syntax:

----
feature-name=feature-value
----

The `release` and `debug` that we have seen in `b2` invocations are just
a shorthand way to specify values of the `variant` feature. For example,
the command above could also have been written this way:

[source,shell]
----
b2 variant=release inlining=off debug-symbols=on
----

`variant` is so commonly-used that it has been given special status as
an _implicit_ feature—Boost.Build will deduce its identity just from the
name of one of its values.

A complete description of features can be found in
link:#bbv2.reference.features[the section called “Features and properties”].

[[bbv2.tutorial.properties.requirements]]
=== Build Requests and Target Requirements

The set of properties specified on the command line constitutes a _build
request_—a description of the desired properties for building the
requested targets (or, if no targets were explicitly requested, the
project in the current directory). The _actual_ properties used for
building targets are typically a combination of the build request and
properties derived from the project's `Jamroot` (and its other Jamfiles,
as described in
link:#bbv2.tutorial.hierarchy[the section called “Project Hierarchies”]).
For example, the locations of `#include`d header files are normally not
specified on the command-line, but described in Jamfiles as _target
requirements_ and automatically combined with the build request for those
targets. Multi-threaded compilation is another example of a typical
target requirement. The Jamfile fragment below illustrates how these
requirements might be specified.

[source]
----
exe hello
    : hello.cpp
    : <include>boost <threading>multi
    ;
----

When `hello` is built, the two requirements specified above will always
be present. If the build request given on the `b2` command-line
explicitly contradicts a target's requirements, the target requirements
usually override (or, in the case of “free” features like
`<include>`, footnote:[See
link:#bbv2.reference.features.attributes[the section called “Feature Attributes”]]
augment) the build request.

TIP: The value of the `<include>` feature is relative to the location of
`Jamroot` where it is used.

[[bbv2.tutorial.properties.project_attributes]]
=== Project Attributes

If we want the same requirements for our other target, `hello2`, we
could simply duplicate them. However, as projects grow, that approach
leads to a great deal of repeated boilerplate in Jamfiles. Fortunately,
there's a better way. Each project can specify a set of _attributes_,
including requirements:

[source]
----
project
    : requirements <include>/home/ghost/Work/boost <threading>multi
    ;

exe hello : hello.cpp ;
exe hello2 : hello.cpp ;
----

The effect would be as if we specified the same requirement for both
`hello` and `hello2`.

[[bbv2.tutorial.hierarchy]]
== Project Hierarchies

So far we have only considered examples with one project, with one
user-written Boost.Jam file, `Jamroot`. A typical large codebase would
be composed of many projects organized into a tree. The top of the tree
is called the _project root_. Every subproject is defined by a file called
`Jamfile` in a descendant directory of the project root. The parent
project of a subproject is defined by the nearest `Jamfile` or `Jamroot`
file in an ancestor directory. For example, in the following directory
layout:

----
top/
  |
  +-- Jamroot
  |
  +-- app/
  |    |
  |    +-- Jamfile
  |    `-- app.cpp
  |
  `-- util/
       |
       +-- foo/
       .    |
       .    +-- Jamfile
       .    `-- bar.cpp
----

the project root is `top/`. The projects in `top/app/` and
`top/util/foo/` are immediate children of the root project.

NOTE: When we refer to a “Jamfile,” set in normal type, we mean a file called
either `Jamfile` or `Jamroot`. When we need to be more specific, the
filename will be set as “`Jamfile`” or “`Jamroot`.”

Projects inherit all attributes (such as requirements) from their
parents. Inherited requirements are combined with any requirements
specified by the subproject. For example, if `top/Jamroot` has

[source]
----
<include>/home/ghost/local
----

in its requirements, then all of its sub-projects will have it in their
requirements, too. Of course, any project can add include paths to those
specified by its parents. footnote:[Many features will be overridden,
rather than added-to, in sub-projects See
link:#bbv2.reference.features.attributes[the section called “Feature Attributes”] for more information] More
details can be found in link:#bbv2.overview.projects[the section called “Projects”].

Invoking `b2` without explicitly specifying any targets on the command
line builds the project rooted in the current directory. Building a
project does not automatically cause its sub-projects to be built unless
the parent project's Jamfile explicitly requests it. In our example,
`top/Jamroot` might contain:

[source]
----
build-project app ;
----

which would cause the project in `top/app/` to be built whenever the
project in `top/` is built. However, targets in `top/util/foo/` will be
built only if they are needed by targets in `top/` or `top/app/`.

[[bbv2.tutorial.libs]]
== Dependent Targets

When building a target `X` that depends on first building another target
`Y` (such as a library that must be linked with X), `Y` is called a
_dependency_ of `X` and `X` is termed a _dependent_ of `Y`.

To get a feeling of target dependencies, let's continue the above
example and see how `top/app/Jamfile` can use libraries from
`top/util/foo`. If `top/util/foo/Jamfile` contains

[source]
----
lib bar : bar.cpp ;
----

then to use this library in `top/app/Jamfile`, we can write:

[source]
----
exe app : app.cpp ../util/foo//bar ;
----

While `app.cpp` refers to a regular source file, `../util/foo//bar` is a
reference to another target: a library `bar` declared in the Jamfile at
`../util/foo`.

TIP: Some other build system have special syntax for listing dependent
libraries, for example `LIBS` variable. In Boost.Build, you just add the
library to the list of sources.

Suppose we build `app` with:

[source,shell]
----
b2 app optimization=full define=USE_ASM
----

Which properties will be used to build `foo`? The answer is that some
features are _propagated_ — Boost.Build attempts to use dependencies with
the same value of propagated features. The `<optimization>` feature is
propagated, so both `app` and `foo` will be compiled with full
optimization. But `<define>` is not propagated: its value will be added
as-is to the compiler flags for `a.cpp`, but won't affect `foo`.

Let's improve this project further. The library probably has some
headers that must be used when compiling `app.cpp`. We could manually
add the necessary `#include` paths to `app`'s requirements as values of
the `<include>  ` feature, but then this work will be repeated for all
programs that use `foo`. A better solution is to modify
`util/foo/Jamfile` in this way:

[source]
----
project
    : usage-requirements <include>.
    ;

lib foo : foo.cpp ;
----

Usage requirements are applied not to the target being declared but to
its dependents. In this case, `<include>.` will be applied to all
targets that directly depend on `foo`.

Another improvement is using symbolic identifiers to refer to the
library, as opposed to `Jamfile` location. In a large project, a library
can be used by many targets, and if they all use `Jamfile` location, a change
in directory organization entails much work.
The solution is to use project ids—symbolic names not tied to directory
layout. First, we need to assign a project id by adding this code to
`Jamroot`:

[source]
----
use-project /library-example/foo : util/foo ;
----

Second, we modify `app/Jamfile` to use the project id:

[source]
----
exe app : app.cpp /library-example/foo//bar ;
----

The `/library-example/foo//bar` syntax is used to refer to the target
`bar` in the project with id `/library-example/foo`. We've achieved our
goal—if the library is moved to a different directory, only `Jamroot` must be
modified. Note that project ids are global—two Jamfiles
are not allowed to assign the same project id to different directories.

[TIP]
====
If you want all applications in some project to link to a certain
library, you can avoid having to specify directly the sources of every
target by using the `<library>` property. For example, if
`/boost/filesystem//fs` should be linked to all applications in your
project, you can add `<library>/boost/filesystem//fs` to the project's
requirements, like this:

[source]
----
project
   : requirements <library>/boost/filesystem//fs
   ;
----
====


[[bbv2.tutorial.linkage]]
== Static and shared libraries

Libraries can be either _static_, which means they are included in
executable files that use them, or _shared_ (a.k.a. _dynamic_), which
are only referred to from executables, and must be available at run
time. Boost.Build can create and use both kinds.

The kind of library produced from a `lib` target is determined by the
value of the `link` feature. Default value is `shared`, and to build a
static library, the value should be `static`. You can request a static
build either on the command line:

[source,shell]
----
b2 link=static
----

or in the library's requirements:

[source]
----
lib l : l.cpp : <link>static ;
----

We can also use the `<link>` property to express linking requirements on
a per-target basis. For example, if a particular executable can be
correctly built only with the static version of a library, we can
qualify the executable's link:#bbv2.reference.targets.references[target
reference] to the library as follows:

[source]
----
exe important : main.cpp helpers/<link>static ;
----

No matter what arguments are specified on the `b2` command line,
`important` will only be linked with the static version of `helpers`.

Specifying properties in target references is especially useful if you
use a library defined in some other project (one you can't change) but
you still want static (or dynamic) linking to that library in all cases.
If that library is used by many targets, you _could_ use target
references everywhere:

[source]
----
exe e1 : e1.cpp /other_project//bar/<link>static ;
exe e10 : e10.cpp /other_project//bar/<link>static ;
----

but that's far from being convenient. A better approach is to introduce
a level of indirection. Create a local `alias` target that refers to the
static (or dynamic) version of `foo`:

[source]
----
alias foo : /other_project//bar/<link>static ;
exe e1 : e1.cpp foo ;
exe e10 : e10.cpp foo ;
----

The link:#bbv2.tasks.alias[alias] rule is specifically used to rename a
reference to a target and possibly change the properties.

[TIP]
====
When one library uses another, you put the second library in the source
list of the first. For example:

[source]
----
lib utils : utils.cpp /boost/filesystem//fs ;
lib core : core.cpp utils ;
exe app : app.cpp core ;
----

This works no matter what kind of linking is used. When `core` is built as a
shared library, links `utils` directly into it. Static libraries can't link
to other libraries, so when `core` is built as a static library, its
dependency on `utils` is passed along to `core`'s dependents, causing `app`
to be linked with both `core` and `utils`.
====

NOTE: (Note for non-UNIX system). Typically, shared libraries must be
installed to a directory in the dynamic linker's search path. Otherwise,
applications that use shared libraries can't be started. On Windows, the
dynamic linker's search path is given by the `PATH` environment variable.
This restriction is lifted when you use Boost.Build testing
facilities—the `PATH` variable will be automatically adjusted before
running the executable.

[[bbv2.tutorial.conditions]]
== Conditions and alternatives

Sometimes, particular relationships need to be maintained among a
target's build properties. For example, you might want to set specific
`#define` when a library is built as shared, or when a target's
`release` variant is built. This can be achieved using _conditional
requirements_.

[source]
----
lib network : network.cpp
    : <link>shared:<define>NETWORK_LIB_SHARED
      <variant>release:<define>EXTRA_FAST
    ;
----

In the example above, whenever `network` is built with `<link>shared`,
`<define>NETWORK_LIB_SHARED` will be in its properties, too. Also, whenever
its release variant is built, `<define>EXTRA_FAST` will appear in its
properties.

Sometimes the ways a target is built are so different that describing
them using conditional requirements would be hard. For example, imagine
that a library actually uses different source files depending on the
toolset used to build it. We can express this situation using target
_alternatives_:

[source]
----
lib demangler : dummy_demangler.cpp ;                # <1>
lib demangler : demangler_gcc.cpp : <toolset>gcc ;   # <2>
lib demangler : demangler_msvc.cpp : <toolset>msvc ; # <3>
----

When building `demangler`, Boost.Build will compare requirements for
each alternative with build properties to find the best match. For
example, when building with `<toolset>gcc` alternative *(2)*, will be
selected, and when building with `<toolset>msvc` alternative *(3)* will be
selected. In all other cases, the most generic alternative *(1)* will be
built.

[[bbv2.tutorial.prebuilt]]
== Prebuilt targets

To link to libraries whose build instructions aren't given in a Jamfile,
you need to create `lib` targets with an appropriate `file` property.
Target alternatives can be used to associate multiple library files with
a single conceptual target. For example:

[source]
----
# util/lib2/Jamfile
lib lib2
    :
    : <file>lib2_release.a <variant>release
    ;

lib lib2
    :
    : <file>lib2_debug.a <variant>debug
    ;
----

This example defines two alternatives for `lib2`, and for each one names
a prebuilt file. Naturally, there are no sources. Instead, the `<file>`
feature is used to specify the file name.

Once a prebuilt target has been declared, it can be used just like any
other target:

[source]
----
exe app : app.cpp ../util/lib2//lib2 ;
----

As with any target, the alternative selected depends on the properties
propagated from `lib2`'s dependents. If we build the release and debug
versions of `app` it will be linked with `lib2_release.a` and
`lib2_debug.a`, respectively.

System libraries — those that are automatically found by the toolset by
searching through some set of predetermined paths — should be declared
almost like regular ones:

[source]
----
lib pythonlib : : <name>python22 ;
----

We again don't specify any sources, but give a `name` that should be
passed to the compiler. If the gcc toolset were used to link an
executable target to `pythonlib`, `-lpython22` would appear in the
command line (other compilers may use different options).

We can also specify where the toolset should look for the library:

[source]
----
lib pythonlib : : <name>python22 <search>/opt/lib ;
----

And, of course, target alternatives can be used in the usual way:

[source]
----
lib pythonlib : : <name>python22 <variant>release ;
lib pythonlib : : <name>python22_d <variant>debug ;
----

A more advanced use of prebuilt targets is described in
link:#bbv2.recipes.site-config[the section called “Targets in
site-config.jam”].
