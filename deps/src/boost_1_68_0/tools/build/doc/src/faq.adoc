[[bbv2.faq.featurevalue]]
== How do I get the current value of feature in Jamfile?

This is not possible, since Jamfile does not have "current" value of any
feature, be it toolset, build variant or anything else. For a single run
of Boost.Build, any given main target can be built with several property
sets. For example, user can request two build variants on the command
line. Or one library is built as shared when used from one application,
and as static when used from another. Each Jamfile is read only once so
generally there is no single value of a feature you can access in
Jamfile.

A feature has a specific value only when building a target, and there
are two ways you can use that value:

* Use conditional requirements or indirect conditional requirements. See
link:#bbv2.overview.targets.requirements.conditional[the section called “Requirements”].
* Define a custom generator and a custom main target type. The custom
generator can do arbitrary processing or properties. See the
link:#bbv2.extender[extender manual]

[[bbv2.faq.duplicate]]
== I am getting a "Duplicate name of actual target" error. What does that mean?

The most likely case is that you are trying to compile the same file
twice, with almost the same, but differing properties. For example:

[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ;
exe b : a.cpp ;
----

The above snippet requires two different compilations of `a.cpp`, which
differ only in their `include` property. Since the `include` feature is
declared as `free` Boost.Build does not create a separate build
directory for each of its values and those two builds would both produce
object files generated in the same build directory. Ignoring this and
compiling the file only once would be dangerous as different includes
could potentially cause completely different code to be compiled.

To solve this issue, you need to decide if the file should be compiled
once or twice.

1.  To compile the file only once, make sure that properties are the
same for both target requests:
+
[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ;
exe b : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ;
----
+
or:
+
[source,jam]
----
alias a-with-include : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ;
exe a : a-with-include ;
exe b : a-with-include ;
----
+
or if you want the `includes` property not to affect how any other
sources added for the built `a` and `b` executables would be compiled:
+
[source,jam]
----
obj a-obj : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ;
exe a : a-obj ;
exe b : a-obj ;
----
+
Note that in both of these cases the `include` property will be applied
only for building these object files and not any other sources that
might be added for targets `a` and `b`.
2.  To compile the file twice, you can tell Boost.Build to compile it to
two separate object files like so:
+
[source,jam]
----
obj a_obj : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ;
obj b_obj : a.cpp ;
exe a : a_obj ;
exe b : b_obj ;
----
+
or you can make the object file targets local to the main target:
+
[source,jam]
----
exe a : [ obj a_obj : a.cpp : <include>/usr/local/include ] ;
exe b : [ obj a_obj : a.cpp ] ;
----
+
which will cause Boost.Build to actually change the generated object
file names a bit for you and thus avoid any conflicts.
+
Note that in both of these cases the `include` property will be applied
only for building these object files and not any other sources that
might be added for targets `a` and `b`.

A good question is why Boost.Build can not use some of the above
approaches automatically. The problem is that such magic would only help
in half of the cases, while in the other half it would be silently doing
the wrong thing. It is simpler and safer to ask the user to clarify his
intention in such cases.

[[bbv2.faq.envar]]
== Accessing environment variables

Many users would like to use environment variables in Jamfiles, for
example, to control the location of external libraries. In many cases it
is better to declare those external libraries in the site-config.jam
file, as documented in the link:#bbv2.recipes.site-config[recipes
section]. However, if the users already have the environment variables
set up, it may not be convenient for them to set up their
site-config.jam files as well and using the environment variables might
be reasonable.

Boost.Jam automatically imports all environment variables into its
built-in .ENVIRON module so user can read them from there directly or by
using the helper os.environ rule. For example:

[source,jam]
----
import os ;
local unga-unga = [ os.environ UNGA_UNGA ] ;
ECHO $(unga-unga) ;
----

or a bit more realistic:

[source,jam]
----
import os ;
local SOME_LIBRARY_PATH = [ os.environ SOME_LIBRARY_PATH ] ;
exe a : a.cpp : <include>$(SOME_LIBRARY_PATH) ;
----

[[bbv2.faq.proporder]]
== How to control properties order?

For internal reasons, Boost.Build sorts all the properties
alphabetically. This means that if you write:

[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp : <include>b <include>a ;
----

then the command line with first mention the `a` include directory, and
then `b`, even though they are specified in the opposite order. In most
cases, the user does not care. But sometimes the order of includes, or
other properties, is important. For such cases, a special syntax is
provided:

[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp : <include>a&&b ;
----

The `&&` symbols separate property values and specify that their order
should be preserved. You are advised to use this feature only when the
order of properties really matters and not as a convenient shortcut.
Using it everywhere might negatively affect performance.

[[bbv2.faq.liborder]]
== How to control the library linking order on Unix?

On Unix-like operating systems, the order in which static libraries are
specified when invoking the linker is important, because by default, the
linker uses one pass though the libraries list. Passing the libraries in
the incorrect order will lead to a link error. Further, this behavior
is often used to make one library override symbols from another. So,
sometimes it is necessary to force specific library linking order.

Boost.Build tries to automatically compute the right order. The primary
rule is that if library `a` "uses" library `b`, then library `a` will
appear on the command line before library `b`. Library `a` is considered
to use `b` if `b` is present either in the `a` library's sources or its
usage is listed in its requirements. To explicitly specify the `use`
relationship one can use the `<use>` feature. For example, both of the
following lines will cause `a` to appear before `b` on the command line:

[source,jam]
----
lib a : a.cpp b ;
lib a : a.cpp : <use>b ;
----

The same approach works for searched libraries as well:

[source,jam]
----
lib z ;
lib png : : <use>z ;
exe viewer : viewer png z ;
----

[[bbv2.faq.external]]
== Can I get capture external program output using a Boost.Jam variable?

The `SHELL` builtin rule may be used for this purpose:

[source,jam]
----
local gtk_includes = [ SHELL "gtk-config --cflags" ] ;
----

[[bbv2.faq.projectroot]]
== How to get the project root (a.k.a. Jamroot) location?

You might want to use your project's root location in your Jamfiles. To
access it just declare a path constant in your `Jamroot.jam` file using:

[source,jam]
----
path-constant TOP : . ;
----

After that, the `TOP` variable can be used in every Jamfile.

[[bbv2.faq.flags]]
== How to change compilation flags for one file?

If one file must be compiled with special options, you need to
explicitly declare an `obj` target for that file and then use that
target in your `exe` or `lib` target:

[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp b ;
obj b : b.cpp : <optimization>off ;
----

Of course you can use other properties, for example to specify specific
C/{CPP} compiler options:

[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp b ;
obj b : b.cpp : <cflags>-g ;
----

You can also use link:#bbv2.tutorial.conditions[conditional properties]
for finer control:

[source,jam]
----
exe a : a.cpp b ;
obj b : b.cpp : <variant>release:<optimization>off ;
----

[[bbv2.faq.dll-path]]
== Why are the `dll-path` and `hardcode-dll-paths` properties useful?

NOTE: This entry is specific to Unix systems.

Before answering the questions, let us recall a few points about shared
libraries. Shared libraries can be used by several applications, or
other libraries, without physically including the library in the
application which can greatly decrease the total application size. It is
also possible to upgrade a shared library when the application is
already installed.

However, in order for application depending on shared libraries to be
started the OS may need to find the shared library when the application
is started. The dynamic linker will search in a system-defined list of
paths, load the library and resolve the symbols. Which means that you
should either change the system-defined list, given by the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, or install the libraries to a
system location. This can be inconvenient when developing, since the
libraries are not yet ready to be installed, and cluttering system paths
may be undesirable. Luckily, on Unix there is another way.

An executable can include a list of additional library paths, which will
be searched before system paths. This is excellent for development
because the build system knows the paths to all libraries and can
include them in the executables. That is done when the
`hardcode-dll-paths` feature has the `true` value, which is the default.
When the executables should be installed, the story is different.

Obviously, installed executable should not contain hardcoded paths to
your development tree. (The `install` rule explicitly disables the
`hardcode-dll-paths` feature for that reason.) However, you can use the
`dll-path` feature to add explicit paths manually. For example:

[source,jam]
----
install installed : application : <dll-path>/usr/lib/snake
                                  <location>/usr/bin ;
----

will allow the application to find libraries placed in the
`/usr/lib/snake` directory.

If you install libraries to a nonstandard location and add an explicit
path, you get more control over libraries which will be used. A library
of the same name in a system location will not be inadvertently used. If
you install libraries to a system location and do not add any paths, the
system administrator will have more control. Each library can be
individually upgraded, and all applications will use the new library.

Which approach is best depends on your situation. If the libraries are
relatively standalone and can be used by third party applications, they
should be installed in the system location. If you have lots of
libraries which can be used only by your application, it makes sense to
install them to a nonstandard directory and add an explicit path, like
the example above shows. Please also note that guidelines for different
systems differ in this respect. For example, the Debian GNU guidelines
prohibit any additional search paths while Solaris guidelines suggest
that they should always be used.

[[bbv2.recipes.site-config]]
== Targets in site-config.jam

It is desirable to declare standard libraries available on a given
system. Putting target declaration in a specific project's Jamfile is
not really good, since locations of the libraries can vary between
different development machines and then such declarations would need to
be duplicated in different projects. The solution is to declare the
targets in Boost.Build's `site-config.jam` configuration file:

[source,jam]
----
project site-config ;
lib zlib : : <name>z ;
----

Recall that both `site-config.jam` and `user-config.jam` are projects,
and everything you can do in a Jamfile you can do in those files as
well. So, you declare a project id and a target. Now, one can write:

[source,jam]
----
exe hello : hello.cpp /site-config//zlib ;
----

in any Jamfile.

[[bbv2.faq.header-only-libraries]]
== Header-only libraries

In modern {CPP}, libraries often consist of just header files, without any
source files to compile. To use such libraries, you need to add proper
includes and possibly defines to your project. But with a large number
of external libraries it becomes problematic to remember which libraries
are header only, and which ones you have to link to. However, with
Boost.Build a header-only library can be declared as Boost.Build target
and all dependents can use such library without having to remember
whether it is a header-only library or not.

Header-only libraries may be declared using the `alias` rule, specifying
their include path as a part of its usage requirements, for example:

[source,jam]
----
alias my-lib
    : # no sources
    : # no build requirements
    : # no default build
    : <include>whatever ;
----

The includes specified in usage requirements of `my-lib` are
automatically added to all of its dependents build properties. The
dependents need not care if `my-lib` is a header-only or not, and it is
possible to later make `my-lib` into a regular compiled library without
having to add the includes to its dependents declarations.

If you already have proper usage requirements declared for a project
where a header-only library is defined, you do not need to duplicate
them for the `alias` target:

[source,jam]
----
project my : usage-requirements <include>whatever ;
alias mylib ;
----

[[bbv2.faq.names]]
== What is the difference between Boost.Build, `b2`, `bjam` and Perforce Jam?

Boost.Build is the name of the complete build system. The executable
that runs it is `b2`. That executable is written in C and implements
performance-critical algorithms, like traversal of dependency graph and
executing commands. It also implements an interpreted language used to
implement the rest of Boost.Build. This executable is formally called
"Boost.Build engine".

The Boost.Build engine is derived from an earlier build tool called
Perforce Jam. Originally, there were just minor changes, and the
filename was `bjam`. Later on, with more and more changes, the
similarity of names because a disservice to users, and as of Boost
1.47.0, the official name of the executable was changed to `b2`. A copy
named `bjam` is still created for compatibility, but you are encouraged
to use the new name in all cases.

Perforce Jam was an important foundation, and we gratefully acknowledge
its influence, but for users today, these tools share only some basics
of the interpreted language.
